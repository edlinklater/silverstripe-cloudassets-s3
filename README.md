Cloud Assets Module
===================
Amazon S3 CloudFiles Driver
---------------------------

**This module is not actively maintained and may not function as expected.**

CloudAssets module allows you to host all or part of the assets folder on a cloud storage container (CDN).
You can find more details about how it works here: <https://github.com/markguinn/silverstripe-cloudassets>

This driver gives you the bucket type S3Bucket for connecting to CloudFiles.

This module can happily co-exist with other bucket driver modules.


Requirements
------------
- Silverstripe 3.1+
- Cloud Assets module
- AWS PHP SDK

Best way to install by far is `composer require edlinklater/silverstripe-cloudassets-s3`.


Example
-------
Assuming you have an S3 bucket called site-uploads:

*mysite/_config/cloudassets.yml:*
```
---
name: assetsconfig
---
CloudAssets:
  map:
    'assets/Uploads':
      Type: S3Bucket
      BaseURL: 'http://yourcdnbaseurl.com/'
      Container: site-uploads
      Region: ap-southeast-2
      ApiKey: yourkey
      ApiSecret: yoursecret
      LocalCopy: true           # Doesn't work without LocalCopy at present
      
S3Bucket:
  write_public: false # Set to true if you wish to allow public read only access for uploaded files
```
